# Introduction #

Gravitational lensing simulation project, inside the research group G.E.M.A.-ASAAF

# Approach #

The idea we are developing is based in raytracing. From the observer's eye position, a ray in every direction is shot. Now, we calculate how it is bent by a central distribution of mass, and eventually, where in a given image arrives. Each ray corresponds to a pixel, and its value is read at that point in the final image.

Also, a luminance process will be added. Some parts of the distorted image collect a wider solid angle of the font, so they should appear lighter.
